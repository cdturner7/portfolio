            <h3>What is Three.js?</h3>
            <p>
                Three.js is a cross-browser JavaScript library and API 
                used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics 
                in a web browser. It utilizes WebGL to bring hardware-accelerated 
                3D graphics to the browser without the need for additional plugins. 
                Here are some key features and benefits of using Three.js:
